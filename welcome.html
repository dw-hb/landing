There is so much text here because this is a test block for messages which do not have a head, because I wanted these messages to not have some funky space on the bottom which also has a border on top. Because I thought it looked funny I would try to modify the base CSS of this website which contains an absolute fuckload of code, because I figured it would look better without the padding on the bottom as it servs the same purpose... as... a headed message... but... fuck.

                    <p class="br">As platforms grow old, first-party support for them is depreciated, before it is eventually rid of by the creators of these platforms. As such, new platforms are developed. These new platforms often have <i>some</i> compatibility with older software, be it through first-party software emulation or support through emulation with a new platform's CPU, or an FPGA dedicated to the task of emulating legacy hardware. <p class="br">Rather than jumping between platforms, many people would rather get the most out of their old, ancient hardware and squeeze out every last bit of usability from these legacy platforms as a means to save money, and to pass these consoles down for future generations to reproduce similar experiences they had with these legacy platforms in their youth. Unfortunately, due to the nature of then-modern platforms with Internet capabilities having support discontinued, services which previously functioned during a platform's lifetime are discontinued, thus causing reproduction of their previous online experiences with the console impossible.</p>
                        <p class="br">Prior to discontinuation and a platform's end-of-life, clever people with special talents exhibit their capabilities by making it so legacy software previously hard-to-find becomes easy to acquire and easily reproducible. Often if a title which relied upon or had additional value with an Internet connection has its service discontinued, such users exhibit their skills of reverse-engineering to restore online access of these services whenever possible.</p>
                        <p class="br">Despite their efforts, hardware fails. People who would otherwise be able to use such platforms, and are rendered unable because of hardware limitations or damage to media are forced to seek out titles for these legacy platforms on the Internet, often in less-than-savoury places and commit the act of <i>piracy</i> to work around failing media and half-broken hardware. Long-running series which may rely upon different media for different goals and achievements are rendered impossible without a platform's capability to use good media, or if the media is too damaged to replicate and play as intended by the platform's manufacturer. And even if a first-party makes these titles available on later, more modern platforms some of their capabilities are limited or removed entirely, rendering reproduction of certain experiences impossible.</p>
                        <p class="br"><i>We don't let that stop us.</i> Dandelion Way is a community founded upon the idea that people should do whatever they like with their hardware for legacy platforms, and we do not look down upon people who would rather save their money for food, utilities and platforms which would serve hardware and software developers better than used hardware exchanges.</p>
                        <p class="br">As such, we support present-day platforms near end-of-life, legacy platforms which had reached end-of-life and people who simply don't want to spend the money they worked so hard for on hardware which will soon lose support, or have no support at all.

                <div class="nestins">
                    <div class="body end">
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#1: Do not be malicious toward others</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">While the occasional roast between friends is fine, if it become personal and sensitive toward addressed individuals then it's time to stop. Some may not take themselves personally. but others may be more sensitive when they feel their personal decisions are put to sport and targeted.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#2: Do not engage unless addressed</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">Recent happenings have made talking about this a necessity: If you're offended at the conduct of another individual, <i>think critically</i> about your response. The best response in most instances is to say nothing and forward concerns to moderators in private. If it doesn't concern you directly, don't bother throwing yourself in the pit; most times people are strong enough to defend themselves, their life decisions and beliefs without external intervention.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#3: Refer to elsewhere if you don't know</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">If you don't know, don't play like you know. Sometimes, the best help can be had by redirecting people to somewhere else. Otherwise, assisting people without knowing the exact details of one's situation can lead to mishaps which may need to be resolved by somebody else. At best, put someone needing exigent help on hold and figure it out on your own machine before forwarding advice.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#4: Try to avoid ideological discussion</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">...Or at least, temper it. We're all human, so we all have our own ideas for the world. However, we prefer if people take a break from that wherever applicable. We have no room for soapboxes as we're already jam-packed with knowledge and information, so whatever box you're standing on may be better served containing what we have than to stand on and shout about how your ideas are so much better than others. If you cannot help yourself from engaging in this discussion, at least humour the idea you might be wrong, and try to have reasoned debate. <b>Moderators have the right to dismiss you by muting, moving or limiting access to channels should your conduct become unreasonable and engagements lack civility.</b> Talk like a human being with a reasoned opinion and you'll be fine.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#5: No direct links to piracy content</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">Just because we support the idea to some effect doesn't mean we can go about breaching Discord's ToS. While tools which require the original game, or software which doesn't directly contribute to piracy is allowed (see Nintendo Homebrew, for instance) direct links to piracy tools are disallowed. However, you're more than free to talk about it and exchange software which breaches the ToS in private, and if they become ridiculously strict about it then you can address individuals on alternativ eservices which are not as strict.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>#6: Don't cheat in online games</u></h3>
                        <p>Unless otherwise consented for gameplay modification and provided to everybody, cheats which provide some competitive advantage and / or removes challenge from titles completely aren't allowed. <b>Moderators have the right to mute and remove you for repeat offences.</b></p>

                    <div class="body end">
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>Be loose</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">Have a little fun with yourself and don't be offended so easily. Be a friend and talk openly. Be as fearless in discussion as you can <i>within reason.</i> And if you screw up, it's okay once in awhile so long you're learning from it.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>Save people trouble</u></h3>
                        <p class="br">If you find a person requesting advice from another guild or community resource is encountering difficulty with certain topics which go against their rules to discuss, bring them to us. Some communities are a bit too ban-happy when users address certain topics, a big part of saving people trouble is to help them from being banned elsewhere, as we're an outlet for the kind of discussion other people dislike having.</p>
                        <h3 class="nobr"><u>Always have fun</u></h3>
                        <p>Not having a good time? Make your own luck and find something awesome to do. If the issue is with another user, address concerns in private to moderating staff and issues will be observed thoroughly before action is taken.</p>

                <div class="nestins">
                    <div class="body end">
                        <p class="br">If you believe yourself capable of handling common moderation tasks, engage in the guild often enough and exhibit great observation of happenings about the place you <i>might</i> be offered the capability to moderate the guild! As a moderator, the following guidelines should be exercised:</p>
                        <ol class="br">
                            <li>Engage with people to defuse scenarios before they become out-of-hand.</li>
                            <li>Warn often, and save drastic action for repeat <i>severe</i> offences.</li>
                            <li>Constantly remind people of how rules are broken, and be patient when change is slow.</li>
                            <li>Escalate to bans only if a reasonable number of warns and private conversations had taken place.</li>
                            <li>Always be open to change: User retention should be prioritized with forgiveness and tolerance as a priority.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Trying to resolve issues in public is still frowned upon, so if you see an ongoing and exigent issue, <b>message a moderator</b> for further evaluation. The owner of this guild aims to not limit free speech, even if it is at the expense of other's feelings as he believes participants can grow stronger through adversity, and as we are an entity on the Internet opinions and ideas which counter others will remain an ongoing issue, so a <i>light touch</i> approach should be exercised to keep conversation as open as possible. Only with repeat offences and declining reputation should any serious action be taken against offending individuals.</p>
